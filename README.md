# Project Overview :
**AtliQ Hardware**, a leading global provider of computer peripherals, initially experienced success but has faced substantial losses in recent years. This downturn is largely due to their reliance on static Excel reports, which lacked the depth needed for informed decision-making. Consequently, they have engaged a data analytics team to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a versatile tool, offering insights across departments such as Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.
# Dashboard Requirements :
•Finance View – This will show the profit and loss statements across different products, markets, customers, etc.

•Sales View – To display the top-performing and bottom-performing customers with different key metrics.

•Marketing View – Similar data as of Sales View but product-based instead of customers.

•Supply Chain – Reliability and accuracy to better understand the supply chain performance.

•Executive View – This includes the integrated view of key insights for executives.
# Project Objectives : 
•Create a solid framework for generating and delivering actionable insights.

•Design an interactive report that offers valuable insights to the finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive teams. Use the provided mockup dashboards as a reference.

•Conduct a thorough analysis of key data sources, including customer behavior, transaction history, product trends, and regional dynamics.

# Approach
• Project Planning.

• Data Collection, Exploration, Transformation.

• Data Modeling.

• Dashboard Preparation.

• Data Validation & Stakeholder Feedback Implementation.

# Solution Unveiled :
Big news! AtliQ Hardware's Power BI dashboard is now operational. With our skills in data modeling, Power Query, DAX, data validation, and dashboard design, we've managed to handle a whopping 1.8 million records. The dashboard provides custom views for the Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams, making decision-making effortless. We've done it!
